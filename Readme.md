# Comments-Database

**Web application created in PHP that allows you to send messages (comments) and then store them in database.
You can also access the database content and display all those comments which can be deleted by one or even all at once.**

**Currently there is additional feature that allows you to generate random rows to the database which stores the coments. It is primarily for testing purposes
to see how it handles and outputs the data**
